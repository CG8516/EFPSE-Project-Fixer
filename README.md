# EFPSE Project Fixer

### An unofficial tool for fixing common issues with Easy FPS Editor v1.5 projects  

## BACKUP YOUR PROJECT BEFORE USING THIS TOOL

Current fixes:
- Editor crash caused by spaces in some filenames (Walls, Floors, Decorations, Enemies).
- Editor crash caused by missing Wall/Floor/Enemy/Decoration textures.
- Engine crash caused by missing key texture files.
- Engine crash caused by doors being placed on an empty tile.


As always with unofficial tools, use this at your own risk.  
There may be unintended side effects, which could lead to your project being irriversibly damaged.  
**Always** make a backup before running this tool.
